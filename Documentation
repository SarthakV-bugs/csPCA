Training data: 1500 cases - 1075 benign (0 label)
				  425 csPCA (lesion labels 2,3,4,5)


X - raw images (different modalities)
Y - (ground truth) - csPCa_lesion_delineations/human_expert/resampled/



##Pre-processing

1. label_map construction of the .nii.gz files to map the case_id with
    the path of the maked annotated files

2. matching the label_map with the raw data case id
    - check for single modality first
    - integrate strict multi-modality
    - consider techniques to account for missing modalities in certain samples
